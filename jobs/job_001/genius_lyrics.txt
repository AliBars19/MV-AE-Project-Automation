Tell me, is you still up? (Up)
It's 5 a.m. and I'm drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck? (Fuck that shit)
One of one, I'm in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? (Mm)
Tellin' you just how I feel right now
You said it's just the drugs and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (Ooh, it's the kid, know it, damn it)
I lied too, way before, before (How they feelin', how they feelin' right here, ooh)
Before I had you right inside my arms (Feelin' like some money tonight)
But then again, I could be drunk (Yeah)
I know, mami, I know (Know), it's 2 a.m., don't stress (Stress)
At three, that bullshit kick in, in thirty, you'll feel your best
I turned my whole spot to crucial, it's crucial, the way I left (It's lit)
Upstairs is like a low, my new bitches be the best (Let's go)
I'm lookin' at her, when her startin' to turn into you (Her)
Now you startin' to fuck up my mind, is it you, is it her?
We brought Booby Trap to the 'burbs
F29 is my address, in case you ain't heard
It's floodin' upstairs, it's a leak
I don't make it squeak, make it squirt
I make this shit beat, bon appétit when I feast
Slippin' and slide through the streets
It takes a finesse, especially in this Cabriolet Jeep
Engine make it hard to creep
Just leave the gate open, through the side door, I'ma creep (Ooh, ooh)
Are you by the Turrell? And are the kids downstairs asleep?
And are you upstairs by yourself? A minute from there
Is there some room for me? Baby, do tell, do tell
Tell me, is you still up? (Up)
It's 5 a.m. and I'm drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck? (Fuck that shit)
One of one, I'm in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? (Mm)
Tellin' you just how I feel right now
You said it's just the drugs and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lied too, way before (Let's go), before
Before I had you right inside my arms
But then again, I could be drunk
