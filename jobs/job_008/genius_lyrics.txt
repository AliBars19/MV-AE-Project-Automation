You can't tie me down, but you could tie me up (Oh)
She on an ego trip, baggage in the trunk (Oh)
So pretty and you know it, my heart goes hammer time
The love we make is poison, it's like my only vice
You're wearing nothing but your perfume ('Fume)
It's one hell of a view (View)
Made me an offer I can't refuse ('Fuse)
I got it bad for you, so baby
Pretty please, come on over and ruin my life
Take my hand while we dance on the edge of a knife
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty please, pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty, pretty, pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty please)
Pretty please come on over and ruin my life
Take my hand while we dance on the edge of a knife
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Yeah
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty, pretty, pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na (Pretty, pretty, pretty please)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh
Na-na-na-na-na
