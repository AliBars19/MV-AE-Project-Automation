Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like ya involved
Like a rebound, no control
No off switch in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We been runnin' out of time
Love, let's talk about love (Let's talk about love, is)
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? (Anything, oh, oh, this)
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt; haunt, haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
